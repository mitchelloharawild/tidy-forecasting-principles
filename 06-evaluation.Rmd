# Forecast evaluation {#accuracy}

Where possible, the accuracy evaluation should be handled by existing tidymodels tools such as [yardstick](https://tidymodels.github.io/yardstick/). It is likely that some changes or extensions will be needed for full support of time series accuracy metrics.

## Accuracy

The [forecast package](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast/) implements accuracy as a function which is applied to a model. Out of sample accuracy can be computed by additionally providing a test set.

It is probably more transparent to compute accuracy metrics by directly providing actual response values and model predictions.
