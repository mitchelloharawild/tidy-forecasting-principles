The ideas presented in this resource are subject to revision, as the development of these tools are still experimental. This text aims to consolidate the information currently dispersed in the fable package documentation, wiki pages, issues, and emails in a way that is more accessible to the wider community. Hopefully this firstly helps us better design and plan the workflow of tidy forecasting, and invite external opinions to ensure that fable works well with the existing tidy modelling developments.
