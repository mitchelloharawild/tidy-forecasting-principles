This allows models to be used for simulating new data sets, which is especially relevant for time series as often future paths beyond the training set are simulated. The simulate method for a fable model should accept these arguments (names chosen for consistency with tidymodels): object: The model itself new_data: The data used for simulation times: The number of simulated series seed: Random generator initialisation The new_data dataset extends existing stats::simulate functionality by allowing the simulation to accept a new time index for simulating beyond the sample (.idx), and allows the simulation to work with a new set of exogenous regressors (say x1 and x2). It is expected that the innovations (.innov) for the simulation are randomly generated for each repition number (rep), which can be achieved using the times argument. However, users should also be able to provide a set of pre-generated innovations (.innov) for each repition (.rep). If these columns are provided in the new_data, then this data will be passed directly to the simulation method (without generating new numbers over times replications). To ensure consistency between simulation methods, fablelite tools prepare this data so that the simulate method for a model can expect to receive new_data in this format: ## # A tsibble: 9 x 5 [1M] ## # Key: .rep [3] ## .rep .idx .innov x1 x2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;mth&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2017 Jan 1.32 5.45 -3.65 ## 2 1 2017 Feb -0.529 -0.311 -3.02 ## 3 1 2017 Mar 0.914 2.98 -1.62 ## 4 2 2017 Jan -1.29 4.97 -0.705 ## 5 2 2017 Feb 0.860 4.86 -0.376 ## 6 2 2017 Mar 0.00726 0.822 -1.47 ## 7 3 2017 Jan 0.0362 -0.676 -1.66 ## 8 3 2017 Feb -0.172 2.54 -1.51 ## 9 3 2017 Mar -0.0185 3.21 -2.92 For the end user, creating simulations would work like this: library(fable) library(tsibbledata) UKLungDeaths %&gt;% LM(mdeaths ~ fourier(&quot;year&quot;, K = 4) + fdeaths) %&gt;% simulate(UKLungDeaths, times = 5) Or, if they wanted to simulate beyond the sample: UKLungDeaths %&gt;% filter(year(index) &lt;= 1978) %&gt;% LM(mdeaths ~ fourier(&quot;year&quot;, K = 4) + fdeaths) %&gt;% simulate( UKLungDeaths %&gt;% filter(year(index) &gt; 1978), times = 5 ) 5.7 Visualisation "]
