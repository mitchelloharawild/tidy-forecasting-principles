Often interpolated values can be taken from model’s fitted values, and some models may support more sophisticated interpolation methods. The forecast package provides the na.interp function for interpolating time series data, which uses linear interpolation for non-seasonal data, and STL decomposition for seasonal data. Tidy time series tools should allow users to interpolate missing values using any appropriate model. For example, the fpp2::mens400 dataset contains Olympic men’s 400m track final winning times. The winning times for the 1916, 1940 and 1944 Olympics are missing from the dataset. We could then interpolate these missing values using the fitted values from a linear model with a trend: as_tsibble(fpp2::mens400) %&gt;% LM(value ~ trend()) %&gt;% interpolate() ## # A tsibble: 31 x 2 [?] ## index value ## &lt;dttm&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1896-01-01 00:00:00 54.2 ## 2 1900-01-01 00:00:00 49.4 ## 3 1904-01-01 00:00:00 49.2 ## 4 1908-01-01 00:00:00 50 ## 5 1912-01-01 00:00:00 48.2 ## 6 1916-01-01 00:00:00 48.8 ## 7 1920-01-01 00:00:00 49.6 ## 8 1924-01-01 00:00:00 47.6 ## 9 1928-01-01 00:00:00 47.8 ## 10 1932-01-01 00:00:00 46.2 ## # ... with 21 more rows 5.5 Re-estimation https://github.com/tidyverts/fable/issues/43 5.5.1 refit() The refitting a model allows the same model to be applied to a new dataset. This is similar to the model argument available in most modelling functions from the forecast package. The refitted model should maintain the same structure and coefficients of the original model, with fitted information updated to reflect the model’s behaviour on the new dataset. It should also be possible to allow re-estimation of parameters using the reestimate argument, which keeps the selected model terms but updates the model coefficients/parameters. It is expected that a refit method uses a fitted model and replacement data to return a mable. Suppose we are using an ETS model to estimate the mdeaths series: library(fable) mdeaths_ets &lt;- as_tsibble(mdeaths) %&gt;% ETS(value) We may be interested in using the same model with the same coefficients to estimate the fdeaths series: refit(mdeaths_ets, as_tsibble(fdeaths)) ## # A mable: 1 model [1M] ## data model ## &lt;list&gt; &lt;model&gt; ## 1 &lt;tsibble [72 × 2]&gt; ETS(M,A,A) 5.5.2 stream() Streaming data into a model allows a model to be extended to accomodate new, future data. Like refit, stream should allow re-estimation of the model parameters. As this can be a costly operation for some models, in most cases updating the parameters should not occur. However it is recommended that the model parameters are updated on a regular basis. Suppose we are estimating electricity demand data (tsibbledata::elecdemand), and after fitting a model to the existing data, a new set of data from the next month becomes available. A (minimal) model for the electricity demand above can be estimated using fasster. fit &lt;- elec_tr %&gt;% fasster(Demand ~ WorkDay %S% (poly(1) + trig(10))) To extend these fitted values to include December’s electricity data, we can use the stream functionality: fit &lt;- fit %&gt;% stream(elec_stream) 5.6 Simulation Much like the tidymodels opinion toward predict, simulate should not default to an archived version of the training set. This allows models to be used for simulating new data sets, which is especially relevant for time series as often future paths beyond the training set are simulated. The simulate method for a fable model should accept these arguments (names chosen for consistency with tidymodels): object: The model itself new_data: The data used for simulation times: The number of simulated series (handled by fablelite) seed: Random generator initialisation (handled by fablelite) The new_data dataset extends existing stats::simulate functionality by allowing the simulation to accept a new time index for simulating beyond the sample (.idx), and allows the simulation to work with a new set of exogenous regressors (say x1 and x2). It is expected that the innovations (.innov) for the simulation are randomly generated for each repition number (rep), which can be achieved using the times argument. However, users should also be able to provide a set of pre-generated innovations (.innov) for each repition (.rep). If these columns are provided in the new_data, then this data will be passed directly to the simulation method (without generating new numbers over times replications). ## # A tsibble: 9 x 5 [1M] ## # Key: .rep [3] ## .rep .idx .innov x1 x2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;mth&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2017 Jan -0.834 1.84 -2.07 ## 2 1 2017 Feb 0.257 4.28 -2.46 ## 3 1 2017 Mar -0.231 5.07 -1.09 ## 4 2 2017 Jan -1.15 0.947 -2.97 ## 5 2 2017 Feb 0.148 3.80 -1.56 ## 6 2 2017 Mar 0.714 3.71 -1.36 ## 7 3 2017 Jan -0.00150 1.65 -0.899 ## 8 3 2017 Feb 0.986 4.33 -1.74 ## 9 3 2017 Mar -1.18 3.67 -3.22 For the end user, creating simulations would work like this: library(fable) library(tsibbledata) UKLungDeaths %&gt;% LM(mdeaths ~ fourier(&quot;year&quot;, K = 4) + fdeaths) %&gt;% simulate(UKLungDeaths, times = 5) ## # A tsibble: 360 x 3 [1M] ## # Key: .rep [5] ## index .rep .sim ## &lt;mth&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1974 Jan 1 2296. ## 2 1974 Feb 1 1752. ## 3 1974 Mar 1 1960. ## 4 1974 Apr 1 1775. ## 5 1974 May 1 1491. ## 6 1974 Jun 1 1381. ## 7 1974 Jul 1 1172. ## 8 1974 Aug 1 1204. ## 9 1974 Sep 1 953. ## 10 1974 Oct 1 1470. ## # ... with 350 more rows Or, if they wanted to simulate beyond the sample: library(lubridate) UKLungDeaths %&gt;% filter(year(index) &lt;= 1978) %&gt;% LM(mdeaths ~ fourier(&quot;year&quot;, K = 4) + fdeaths) %&gt;% simulate( UKLungDeaths %&gt;% filter(year(index) &gt; 1978), times = 5 ) ## # A tsibble: 60 x 3 [1M] ## # Key: .rep [5] ## index .rep .sim ## &lt;mth&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1979 Jan 1 2152. ## 2 1979 Feb 1 1939. ## 3 1979 Mar 1 1793. ## 4 1979 Apr 1 1683. ## 5 1979 May 1 1226. ## 6 1979 Jun 1 1150. ## 7 1979 Jul 1 1288. ## 8 1979 Aug 1 971. ## 9 1979 Sep 1 1119. ## 10 1979 Oct 1 1132. ## # ... with 50 more rows 5.7 Visualisation "]
