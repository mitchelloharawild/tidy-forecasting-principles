For consistency with stats::simulate(), the simulate method for a fable model should accept these arguments: object: The model itself nsim: The number of simulated series (note: this differs from forecastâ€™s usage which is the length of the series) seed: Random generator initialisation Additionally, it is recommended that model simulations for fable also accept a tsibble containing new_data. This dataset extends existing simulate functionality by allowing the simulation to accept a new time index for simulating beyond the sample (.idx), a set of pre-generated innovations (.innov), and a new set of exogenous regressors (say x1 and x2). For repeated simulations, the tsibble is keyed by the repitition number (.rep). ## # A tsibble: 9 x 5 [1M] ## # Key: .rep [3] ## .rep .idx .innov x1 x2 ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;mth&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 2017 Jan -0.434 6.42 -2.24 ## 2 1 2017 Feb -0.589 2.40 -0.580 ## 3 1 2017 Mar -0.488 2.45 -2.40 ## 4 2 2017 Jan 0.787 3.72 -1.30 ## 5 2 2017 Feb 0.934 3.39 -2.60 ## 6 2 2017 Mar 0.937 2.51 -1.01 ## 7 3 2017 Jan 1.61 1.20 -2.00 ## 8 3 2017 Feb 0.266 0.376 -0.947 ## 9 3 2017 Mar 0.343 5.42 -2.64 5.7 Visualisation "]
