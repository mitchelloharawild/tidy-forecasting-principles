Estimating multiple models is a **key** feature of fable. Most time series can be naturally disaggregated using a series of factors known as keys. These keys are used to uniquely identify separate time series, each of which can be modelled separately.

```{r batch}
UKLungDeaths %>% 
  gather("sex", "deaths") %>% 
  ETS(deaths)
```
